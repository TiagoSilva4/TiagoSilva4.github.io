            <p> Hi, I am Tiago Silva! I am a rising senior at James Madison University studying Computer Science.
                My journey to studying computer science was not a regular one, I began studying Pre-Med with the aspiration
                of becoming an anesthesiologist. However, after about two semesters of being disinterested in what I was going
                to spend the rest of my life doing I decided to pivot into something I have always enjoyed, problem Solving.
            </p>

            <p>This love for problem solving led me to Computer Science and I could not be happier with my decision to switch.
                Looking into my future, I am aiming for a role in software engineering or development because I feel those would
                best suit my personality and talents.
            </p>

            <p>In my time away from studying and working on projects, I really enjoy going on hikes, working out, watching soccer games,
                and movies. My favorite soccer team is Benfica from the Primeria Liga, and my current favorite movie is Interstellar.
